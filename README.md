<p> This extension will override the new page default that Google has implemented. The goal is to create a new page for the Alzheimer's population in order to help them with day to day tasks. </p>
<p> When the user first downloads the app, they will be prompted with questions regarding their background. This can be filled out with a family member. The family member can also have access to the back-end in case they want to change the settings later. </p>
<p> Information to prompt: </p>
<ul>
  <li>First Name, Last Name</li>
  <li>Birthday</li>
  <li>Google Account</li>
  <li>Calendar Access</li>
  <li>Family</li>
  <li>Hobbies</li>
  <li>Medication</li>
</ul>
<p> Following the initial setup, everytime the user opens a new tab, it will present them with a picture or basic information. </p>
