<p> This extension will override the new page default that Google has implemented. The goal is to create a new page for the Alzheimer's population in order to help them with day to day tasks. </p>
<p> When the user first downloads the app, they will be prompted with questions regarding their background. This can be filled out with a family member. The family member can also have access to the back-end in case they want to change the settings later. </p>
